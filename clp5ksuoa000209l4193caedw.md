Whether you are self-taught like me, a bootcamp graduate or an undergrad - If you are looking for your first development job you have probably heard the phrase “grind LeetCode” multiple times.

A lot of aspiring developers tend to think that somehow, solving hundreds of LeetCode problems will magically get them hired. Getting into your first (or second, or third) development job is not all that straightforward.

While “grinding LeetCode" is beneficial for you as an engineer - I would like to point your attention to a different take (which is also my personal experience). And let you know there is more than one way to bake a cake.

### You don’t have to be an amazing algorithmist to get a developer job!

Yes, you’ve heard that right.

Algorithms were never my strong suit, I probably cannot solve a lot of LeetCode’s medium-difficulty questions in a reasonable time frame, not to talk about hard ones. But here I am, living proof that you can be a successful developer who is respected by his peers and has been working as an engineer for many years - without being an algorithmic megamind.

Realistically, the arsenal of skills you will have to acquire to have a thriving career as a software engineer is wide, and solving LeetCode-type problems is just one type of the many challenges you will encounter.

In this article, we will go over a list of skills (some engineering-related, some interpersonal) that will not only make you a better developer but will help you be a favorite candidate in almost every development interview.

By working on and improving these skills, you will raise your chances of landing a developer job just as much, if not more than "grinding LeetCode".

### Bring value as an engineer - have in-depth knowledge

Whether you are a frontend, backend, or mobile developer - you will benefit greatly from having in-depth knowledge of your tech stack. Having such knowledge of the language, tool or framework required for a job, will greatly increase your chances of making an impression during an interview.

To make yourself a valuable engineer, you must get out of the *“generic comfort zone”* (or the *"npm install solution"*, if you would) and dive deeper than others, explore farther than anyone, go down to the undocumented depths of software and gain knowledge far superior to the average developer.

It is not enough to know how Javascript handles asynchronous events, you must find out how the Javascript engine handles the language itself! What is the compilation target and steps, and which methods are compiled more efficiently than others? Gaining such extensive knowledge will broaden your horizons and help you make an amazing impression during an interview. It will also make you a better engineer overall. This approach can be migrated and applied to every language, framework or tool you wish to master.

### Familiarize yourself with how the system works

Let’s double down on “having in-depth knowledge” shall we? For you to be an amazing engineer (that lands the job), you must understand how the system operates.

I am not talking about anything specific, I am talking about the *"macro view"* of things.

If you are a back-end engineer, you must know how back-ends operate. How does the database connect to the server or servers? Is my language of choice a compiled language or is it running on a runtime? What are the best practices I should adopt and what anti-patterns should I avoid? Does my stack have architectural standardizations that are already battle-tested?

If you are a front-end engineer, and I were to wake you up in a panic at 3 AM, you should be able to answer the following questions off the top of your head: How does state management work? What is a bundler? How do bundlers work? What is a UI framework? Why do we use them? How does your framework do X and Y? and so on, you get the gist.

You are probably thinking that some of this knowledge will only come from experience, and yes, you are correct. But just like it is possible to self-teach such extensive knowledge of a language or tool, it is also possible to gain in-depth knowledge of software architecture relevant to your field.

### Jack of no trades, master of one

Or in other words - find a niche and stick with it for as long as you can.

I have mentioned in one of my earlier articles that passion is key. It is important to note that while passion is key, it is also dynamic to a fault. Being a developer consists of having to learn many different subjects, in many different fields.

If you are just beginning your development journey, it is more than likely going to be an overwhelming experience to try and understand all the different subjects, tools and practices involved. The amount of knowledge that exists under the “web dev” category is practically impossible to master! That is why you must find your niche and stick with it for as long as you can.

It is natural to jump around and try different things, see which are more up your alley. It is also beneficial for you as an engineer to make sense of how different technologies work. But remember that being a master of one field is more valuable than having shallow knowledge of many.

For example - my niche for many years was backend architecture, and I am a backend engineer in my daily job. After many years, I have felt that I knew quite a lot about the backend side of things and wanted to try something new. I started researching embedded programming and these days I am working on multiple embedded systems in my free time.

In both cases, I found a niche I liked and worked hard on improving my knowledge of that niche, staying hyperfocused on it without jumping from one field to another on a whim.

### Know that you don't know

Have humility, you should never act as if your way is the only correct way. Even the most talented and experienced developers should know that they don't know everything.

![](https://media.tenor.com/xkzH9Ozx1yIAAAAC/shrug-papadin-shrug.gif align="center")

Software engineering is a very broad and opinionated field, beyond the agreed-upon standardizations there are many solutions and approaches that one might find good, amazing or horrible. Most of these are just opinions, and they don't matter much. Don't take criticism as a personal attack, and don't take personal opinions about software to heart.

It is a constantly changing field, and the best practices of today might be obsolete tomorrow - therefore you must learn to adapt, be quick on your feet, and not get attached to any specific technology more than necessary.

If it's not working - you should ask how can we fix it. If it's working - you should ask how can we *improve it*.

Remember that being a developer is a state of mind more than anything, and even if you believe you are an amazing developer, there is always someone more experienced or more specialized than you (and you should shadow them to learn as much as possible).

### Upsell yourself, have confidence

*No, I am not telling you to lie on your resume.* I am telling you to learn how to adapt the way you write and speak about yourself as a professional, adopting a more confident and impressive tone.

I once built a chat feature for a mobile app, it was a carbon copy of WhatsApp as a feature (although less polished), and it took me about two months from start to finish. I later wrote the following on my resume:

> Used tech\_a, and tech\_b to build a WhatsApp-styled real-time messaging system for X's mobile application, used by thousands of daily active users worldwide.

Everything I have written in my resume is true, I did not lie about the technology, the functionality or the number of active users - But I did present it in a way that makes me sound very attractive to an employer.

The bottom line is to try and find the balance between being proud of your skills and still knowing that you don't know everything. This is also a very good thumb rule for life - be proud, yet humble.

### Have fun, and brainstorm

If you are in this industry solely for the money, do yourself a favor and find something else that you are passionate about (I am saying this because I care about your mental health).

Remember that your interviewer is a human being, you are a human being, and none of us are perfect or anywhere near that - so don't take life so seriously!

Try and have fun while you are interviewing - it is a unique experience that can be fun depending on your perspective and state of mind. Even if you feel like you can't find a solution during the live-coding challenge, be honest about it and try and brainstorm with your interviewer to work your way up to a solution (most interviewers will appreciate the fact you are speaking through your hurdles and will give you extra points for it).

*Uplifting side-note: On multiple occasions during my professional career I have failed the technical interview but still got an offer! This is the direct result of the skills I have described in this article.*

This pretty much sums up my take on how to get your first (or any) developer job. Don't seek perfection - seek passion, and stay focused on your goals. With enough perseverance, you will be able to land a job and start your professional development journey.
